# XAI PROTOCOL

## Introduction

Xai hook protocol provides an automated way to issue and redeem XAI USD, an over-collateralised stablecoin backed with XAH.

Sending XAH to it creates a vault and sends back the corresponding amount of XAI USD stablecoin based on the current XAH price. XAI USD can be redeemed at any time against the vault to get back the original XAH.

The collateralization ratio is set to 200%, so for each $100 value of XAH collateralized the protocol issues a loan of $50 value in XAI USD stablecoin, so a 50 XAI USD loan. The liquidation ratio is set to 117%, so if XAH price goes down and the collateral value falls bellow 117%, in this case, if the vault value falls bellow $58'5, then anyone who wants to top up the vault can come along and take it over.

Consider the previous vault, an initial XAH diposit with $100 value and a 50 XAI USD loan issued ($50 loan). Let's say XAH price falls to the point that the initial position has now a $58 value, which results in a 116% collateralization ratio. That means the collateralization is bellow 117% and for that reason the vault can be taken over.

In Loan-to-Value (LTV) terms, an initial loan with 50% the value of the collateral. The position gets liquidated if the LTV ratio goes just above 83%, so a 33% secure margin from the initial position is enforced by the protocol.

For demostration purposes we will create 2 different examples, so we will create 2 similar hooks, one that works with an oracle that reproduces different hypothetical market conditions regarding XAH price, and another one that works with an oracle that follows current XAH price.

Example 1: as this project launches on the Xahau mainnet, XAH price in the market doesn't change as required for testing and explanations purposes, so we will use Example 1 to show how the protocol works. In order to do that we need to change the price to show hook behavior in such escenarios. Example 1 uses an oracle where we set XAH price arbitrarily to simulate different market conditions. 

Example 2: here we will create a similar hook that works with XAH real price, we will use Wietse Wind XRPL Labs oracle to obtain XAH price. XAH price is relatively stable so here we can't go beyond the current price, so we will just show how in fact the protocol behaves considering the current XAH price.

## EXAMPLE 1 (XAH price is fixed and the oracle is set and changed by us arbitrarily for demonstration purposes)

### Accounts required

4 accounts are required: Carol, Alice, Carlos and Charlie.

Carol = XAI USD stablecoin issuer, user sends XAH to this account which is the hook account:
https://xahau.xrplwin.com/account/r9DSnJkkyva4NdShyxw32Q217B7PMZuB9c
https://xahauexplorer.com/explorer/r9DSnJkkyva4NdShyxw32Q217B7PMZuB9c

Alice = XAI USD stablecoin user, sends XAH to the issuer-hook to diposit it as collateral to obtain XAI USD:
https://xahau.xrplwin.com/account/rsF3rBFyQP2zCheJ2woHv46XHvUyKVRK86
https://xahauexplorer.com/explorer/rsF3rBFyQP2zCheJ2woHv46XHvUyKVRK86

Carlos = oracle that stablishes XAH price, low account = oracle_lo
https://xahauexplorer.com/explorer/rHBsTkCaTR86RGKVt3bTUhZAu2NSTZbNSv
https://xahau.xrplwin.com/account/rHBsTkCaTR86RGKVt3bTUhZAu2NSTZbNSv

Charlie = oracle that stablishes XAH price, high account = oracle_hi
https://xahauexplorer.com/explorer/rJ2GzPBeCoK9NjmJ9vcVntVj2poEvjfvEv
https://xahau.xrplwin.com/account/rJ2GzPBeCoK9NjmJ9vcVntVj2poEvjfvEv

### Set up process

Run decode.js, twice, to convert Carlos and Charlie raddresses to binary form, save the values somewhere. You can obtain the same result using this tool: https://hooks.services/tools/raddress-to-accountid

If the Carlos account number (the "Account index" number in explorers) is numerically higher than Charlie, switch the accounts (either re-import them, or just switch their names in the following text).

Set up trust limit for the stablecoin user, by running trust-user.js. The script requires 2 parameters:
The user account (Alice) sends the TrustSet transaction, so that the script requires its private key.
The hook account (Carol) is set up as the trusted issuer. Example:
Trustline transaction: https://xahauexplorer.com/explorer/61CADE17601483D84DC6BF28EC16634A31FC18101E2551806533EE990657D197

Set up trust limit on the oracle, by running trust-oracle.js. The script requires 2 parameters:
The low account (Carlos) sends the TrustSet transaction, so that the script requires its private key.
The high account (Charlie) is set up as the trusted issuer. In this case we set it initially at 1 XAH = 33 XAI USD:
Trustline transaction: https://xahauexplorer.com/explorer/136D9947C156DA3646A37C8539D4984CFC4D6C293130EC63FF465F64DD8DBF91

The file xai.c contains the hook code and it has to be compiled to .wasm, it can be compiled using Hooks Tookit: 
https://hooks-toolkit.com/ 

Then the xai.wasm file can be converted to binary code using a tool like this one:
https://wasdk.github.io/wasmcodeexplorer/

Use that binary format code to deploy the hook to Carol account (hook account, issuer), it has to be set as "ttPayment" and with these 2 parameters (you can use this Xrplwin tool to set the hook, login and paste the binary code and follow instructions: https://xahau.xrplwin.com/tools/hook/from-binary):

Parameter 1. parameter name "oracle_lo" = 6F7261636C655F6C6F, set to Carlos (low oracle) binary account = B1683A099ECF7CD79482728A96675967D03FA8E6

Parameter 2. parameter name "oracle_hi" = 6F7261636C655F6869, set to the Charlie (high oracle) binary account = C0C536597D939AE09DBABBA336795A42422207E6

SetHook transaction (Example 1 code, xai.c, xai.wasm): https://xahau.xrplwin.com/tx/C4451CF30DB1BD1CD22127B3A2A4D53ADCC6B714D6595DB4EA153D819C33DD29

### Using the protocol

Set up a payment transaction from Alice (which sends the amount of XAH she wants to collateralize) to Carol (hook, issuer). The hook will issue-mint and send back the corresponding XAI USD stablecoin amount.

Alice user that wants XAI USD stablecoin sends 3 XAH to the XAI USD issuer-hook:
https://xahauexplorer.com/explorer/EB9BD926FEAFCEE6D01AC00DACEDAFE9B0982D531E044462AB1EE1BDBA38C559

Carol XAI USD issuer-hook when receives 3 XAH mints 49'5 XAI USD and sends it to Alice: 
https://xahauexplorer.com/explorer/B424543808E8CFAF4C777DEE743255C2A2B622438FA92B30E3D761BB3821C3C3

From now on any user-account can collateralize XAH and receive XAI USD stablecoin following these steps:

Step 1: set the XAI USD trustline on the user-account scanning the following QR code:
https://xahau.services/?issuer=r9DSnJkkyva4NdShyxw32Q217B7PMZuB9c&currency=XAI&limit=10000000000

Step 2: sent a XAH payment from the user-account to Carol-hook-issuer account.
https://xahauexplorer.com/explorer/34D833E869E3BC398630B72796EACE578CE81961ED44A510DA08D811F01AED18
https://xahauexplorer.com/explorer/747F79B45121B1F1C518745C93CBBAF416EEF80A3B4986183F8854E5355628C1

### The oracle

The exchange rate between XAH and XAI USD stablecoin is the limit set on a trustline established between two special oracle accounts, account oracle Carlos sets a XAI USD trustline to Charlie oracle account setting as a limit the current XAH price on the market. The price of XAH is representend in XAI USD terms using Carlos and Charlie oracles account. In normal circumstances these accounts will update automatically tracking XAH real price expressed in XAI USD stablecoin terms. In this case, Example 1, we set initially and arbitrarily at 1 XAH = 33 XAI USD. 

### What happens when XAH price changes

Let's assume that XAH price goes down, let's say, to 10 XAI USD, so 1 XAH = 10 XAI USD. Then Carlos oracle account has to change-update the limit on the trustline set to Charlie oracle account, in this case we update it performing and account set transaction updating the trustline limit to 10:
https://xahauexplorer.com/explorer/DBC693D003E213556035D6331A13799FB6C00145BFAECEFD83E81A4030625B37

Once the new limit/price is set, Carol hook account sends the new proportional amount of XAI USD corresponding to the new price set. As XAH price went down, the amount of XAI USD sent for the same amount of XAH is much lower. Compare the amounts in the previous examples with the new one. 

We had 2 examples with XAH price set at 33 XAI USD with these results:

One user (Alice) sent to the hook 3 XAH and received 49'5 XAI USD.

The other user (Ridworld) sent 5 XAH to the hook and received 82'5 XAI USD.

https://xahauexplorer.com/explorer/EB9BD926FEAFCEE6D01AC00DACEDAFE9B0982D531E044462AB1EE1BDBA38C559

https://xahauexplorer.com/explorer/B424543808E8CFAF4C777DEE743255C2A2B622438FA92B30E3D761BB3821C3C3

https://xahauexplorer.com/explorer/34D833E869E3BC398630B72796EACE578CE81961ED44A510DA08D811F01AED18

https://xahauexplorer.com/explorer/747F79B45121B1F1C518745C93CBBAF416EEF80A3B4986183F8854E5355628C1

Here the new results the user obtains once XAH price changed from 33 XAI USD to 10 XAI USD:

The new user sent to the hook 3 XAH but just received 15 XAI USD (instead of the previous 49'5 XAI USD):

https://xahauexplorer.com/explorer/49464AFE057E71D9BAC3695313283D024B06EC987B23228291819563A67DE05C

https://xahauexplorer.com/explorer/5FBA4D83FEC1C9C937069120F2295171187A9EDA181A158BAC1F1E6D7C9CBF8D

Similarly, the new user sent to the hook 5 XAH but just received 15 XAI USD (instead of the previous 82'5 XAI USD):

https://xahauexplorer.com/explorer/C846D0943BE874DDDF8B4D0584C10108713350826E8BEF2958494ED9C0203052

https://xahauexplorer.com/explorer/1D4C0DC38D08242A0E3ACA1D3A580F5950C3584429A964C29EACD6C7F0CF9220

### Recollateralization

What happens to users vaults now that XAH price went down so their vaults are less collateralized?

Now that the price went down, users can send back XAI USD or just send XAH in both cases to increase the collateralization of their position. While users vaults are undercollateralized every XAH the corresponding user sents back to the hook account doesn't generate new XAI USD, it is just used to increase the vault collateralization to return again to the 200% ratio.

See for example what happened with Alice vault once XAH price went down to 10 XAI USD; when she sends XAH to the hook she receives the following response: "Xai: Vault is undercollateralized, absorbing without sending anything."

https://xahauexplorer.com/explorer/240466812A11CDC49A6D946943F468964FF8211DED52E0DAC30BFB4B5DDEAA42

### Take over a vault

Once a vault goes bellow 117% collateralization any user can take over the vault by sending the needed amount of XAH to bring it back to a secure degree of collateralization above 117%. By doing that the user takes control over the vault.

Let's set XAH price at 1 XAI USD:
https://xahauexplorer.com/explorer/A5D0DB88A4B156352D991095D84E54D303A83C4D0C9DF32B2C07FC2DF898AF56

So Alices vault becomes undercollateralized bellow the 117% ratio. Now any user can take over the vault by collateralizing it with XAH to bring it back above 117% again. How can any user do that? 

A vault is identified with the Vault ID, which consists in the following data combined: Account ID + FFFFFFFF + 0000000000000000

a) Account ID: for example, Alice user account rsF3rBFyQP2zCheJ2woHv46XHvUyKVRK86 has as Account ID: 1ED9A5D3DDC00560601FA55482D7956559002B27

b) If absent a tag (let's assume we have no tags): FFFFFFFF

c) 0 up to 64 characters: 0000000000000000

So, in this case, Alice Vault ID is: 1ED9A5D3DDC00560601FA55482D7956559002B27FFFFFFFF0000000000000000

The Vault ID coincides with the HookStateKey field, present in the HookState. You can check it for example in the raw transaction data (Raw TX data) in any payment the user did to the hook account to create or top a vault:
https://xahau.xrplwin.com/tx/EB9BD926FEAFCEE6D01AC00DACEDAFE9B0982D531E044462AB1EE1BDBA38C559#raw

The Vault ID is use to take over a vault, so we use the Vault ID as Invoice ID. Any user in order to take over a vault has the send a payment transaction which contains the InvoiceID field. The InvoiceID field has to contain the Vault ID the user wants to take over.

Take over transaction example:

{

  "TransactionType": "Payment",
  
  "Account": "r4VzEm7Jbgg3QkPBgMscoppz6JuzK2Jkbd",
  
  "Destination": "r9DSnJkkyva4NdShyxw32Q217B7PMZuB9c",
  
  "InvoiceID": "1ED9A5D3DDC00560601FA55482D7956559002B27FFFFFFFF0000000000000000",
  
  "Amount": "2000000",
  
  "NetworkID": 21337
  
}

"Account": "r4VzEm7Jbgg3QkPBgMscoppz6JuzK2Jkbd" = is the user non-owner of the vault that wants to take over the vaoult.

"Destination": "r9DSnJkkyva4NdShyxw32Q217B7PMZuB9c" = is the hook account.

"InvoiceID": "1ED9A5D3DDC00560601FA55482D7956559002B27FFFFFFFF0000000000000000" = it's the owner of the vault we want to take over, in this case Alice rsF3rBFyQP2zCheJ2woHv46XHvUyKVRK86.

See for example the response we receive when let's say r4VzEm7Jbgg3QkPBgMscoppz6JuzK2Jkbd, not the owner of the valt, tries to take over a vault which has a 15 XAI USD loan debt, but doesn't send enough XAI USD or XAH to take over it, it gets this response "Xai: Vault is undercollateralized and your deposit would not redeem it", as expected. See the result when the user sends just 14 XAI USD:
https://xahauexplorer.com/explorer/AC9537550CAA30EC6D3B29A15D59702A0F4C658BE2CED133943CEF027F0FBEBF

### Critical error in the takeover mode

Let's see what happens if an user, not the owner of a liquidatable vault, sends enough amount of value to payback the debt, let's say 15 XAI USD or more, or the equivalent amount of XAH for that value... WARNING: the code doesn't work properly! When an user sends enough money to payback debt and gain ownership of a vault the code gives the following response "Xai: Vault is not sufficiently undercollateralized to take over yet" https://xahauexplorer.com/explorer/F2C8C83F1A468F34CAA1EC6DB1FB2C440BE9468E27AB3ED05C9DCF7E97069EB2, but in fact it is sufficiently undercollateralized. I tested several times and happens the same at any price.

At any price above the liquidation price the code gives: "Xai: Vault is undercollateralized and your deposit would not redeem it", as expected.

But at any price bellow the liquidation price (and at the exactly liquidation price): "Vault is not sufficiently undercollateralized to take over yet", which is not true and incoherent.

So, the liquidation ratio doesn't work properly. The code doesn't take over vaults. If anybody wants to continue this project he should fix the liquidation ratio related code, i'm not able to fix the code at that level.

## EXAMPLE 2 (XAH price is set using Wietse Wind oracle)

### Accounts required

4 accounts are required: Carol, Alice, Carlos and Charlie.

Carol = XAI USD stablecoin issuer, user sends XAH to this account which is the hook account:
https://xahau.xrplwin.com/account/rM9T2RiKDamqz4j5YYvPnVkefgWip3195N
https://xahauexplorer.com/explorer/rM9T2RiKDamqz4j5YYvPnVkefgWip3195N

Alice = XAI USD stablecoin user, sends XAH to the issuer-hook to diposit it as collateral to obtain XAI USD:
https://xahau.xrplwin.com/account/rLni95nuk7NZw7d2ZRqoikxB1h2ZyoojbP
https://xahauexplorer.com/explorer/rLni95nuk7NZw7d2ZRqoikxB1h2ZyoojbP

Carlos = oracle that stablishes XAH price, low account = oracle_lo
https://xahauexplorer.com/explorer/rXUMMaPpZqPutoRszR29jtC8amWq3APkx
https://xahau.xrplwin.com/account/rXUMMaPpZqPutoRszR29jtC8amWq3APkx

Charlie = oracle that stablishes XAH price, high account = oracle_hi
https://xahauexplorer.com/explorer/r9PfV3sQpKLWxccdg3HL2FXKxGW2orAcLE
https://xahau.xrplwin.com/account/r9PfV3sQpKLWxccdg3HL2FXKxGW2orAcLE

### Set up process

Run decode.js, twice, to convert Carlos and Charlie raddresses to binary form, save the values somewhere. You can obtain the same result using this tool: https://hooks.services/tools/raddress-to-accountid

Set up trust limit for the stablecoin user, by running trust-user.js. The script requires 2 parameters:
The user account (Alice) sends the TrustSet transaction, so that the script requires its private key.
The issuer hook account (Carol) is set up as the trusted issuer.
Trustline transaction: https://xahauexplorer.com/explorer/D86D91A9CEBA04DC58FFADBDF6EEC3404DCA79CA67B0FFE5F1B4331E8E24E83F

In this case, as the oracle is set by Wietse Wind XRPL Labs, we don't need to do set up the oracle. If for any reason you are setting an oracle yourself, consider this:
Set up trust limit on the oracle, by running trust-oracle.js. The script requires 2 parameters:
The low account (Carlos) sends the TrustSet transaction, so that the script requires its private key.
The high account (Charlie) is set up as the trusted issuer. 

The file xai2.c contains the hook code and it has to be compiled to .wasm, it can be compiled using Hooks Tookit: 
https://hooks-toolkit.com/ 

Then the xai2.wasm file can be converted to binary code using a tool like this one:
https://wasdk.github.io/wasmcodeexplorer/

Use that binary format code to deploy the hook to Carol account (hook account, issuer), it has to be set as "ttPayment" and with these 2 parameters (you can use this Xrplwin tool to set the hook, login and paste the binary code and follow instructions: https://xahau.xrplwin.com/tools/hook/from-binary):

Parameter 1. parameter name "oracle_lo" = 6F7261636C655F6C6F, set to Carlos (low oracle) binary account = 05B5F43AF717B81948491FB7079E4F173F4ECEB3

Parameter 2. parameter name "oracle_hi" = 6F7261636C655F6869, set to the Charlie (high oracle) binary account = 5BEF921A217D57FDA5B56D5B40BEE40D1AC1127F

SetHook transaction (Example 2 code, xai2.c, xai2.wasm): https://xahau.xrplwin.com/tx/2095A3169ABC3E0535122EC3173A8AF30230ADF498423702993C30543E01E41D

### Using the protocol

Set up a payment transaction from Alice (which sends the amount of XAH she wants to collateralize) to Carol (hook, issuer). The hook will issue-mint and send back the corresponding XAI USD stablecoin amount. In this case we are dealing with XAH real price, at the time of writting this document XAH price was around 0'08 USD.

Alice user that wants XAI USD stablecoin sends 5 XAH to the XAI USD issuer-hook:
https://xahauexplorer.com/explorer/A033EA9746B47CABD22215260A19E17F3680D13E35F58BC8AE8188A160A6A6B0

Carol XAI USD issuer-hook when receives 5 XAH mints 0'21 XAI USD and sends it to Alice: 
https://xahauexplorer.com/explorer/58C77CCA37E0FD084A5323C29BECE640BA90FDC4DF1FF322A0FA90156BE96C96

From now on any user-account can collateralize XAH and receive XAI USD stablecoin following these steps (you can try it yourself following these 2 steps, sending a small amount of XAH just for testing purposes):

Step 1: set the XAI USD trustline on the user-account scanning the following QR code:
https://xahau.services/?issuer=rM9T2RiKDamqz4j5YYvPnVkefgWip3195N&currency=USD&limit=10000000000

Step 2: sent a XAH payment from the user-account to Carol-hook-XAI-USD-issuer account.
https://xahauexplorer.com/explorer/D9D06EF43A367577D3C2927813361F059E630DA8F405320D995BCA53D3E3451F
https://xahauexplorer.com/explorer/8861E7B9AAC7399E4707671476C71FA8DA8F98CE29F992F45CB9A7E22E1033EE

### The oracle

The exchange rate between XAH and XAI USD stablecoin is the limit set on a trustline established between two special oracle accounts, Carlos oracle account sets a XAI USD trustline to Charlie oracle account setting as a limit the current XAH price on the market. The price of XAH is representend in XAI USD terms using Carlos and Charlie oracles account. In this case this oracle set for XAH on Xahau (https://xahauexplorer.com/explorer/rXUMMaPpZqPutoRszR29jtC8amWq3APkx) is set by Wietse Wind from XRPL Labs, it fetches XAH price information using exchange API's and updates the oracle trustline limit with that price, see his proposal here: https://dev.to/wietse/aggregated-xrp-usd-price-info-on-the-xrp-ledger-1087, and the code here: https://github.com/XRPL-Labs/XRP-Price-Aggregator, and here: https://github.com/XRPL-Labs/XRPL-Persist-Price-Oracle.

### What happens when XAH price changes

In this case we can't show what happens if the price goes up or down because the oracle shows the current XAH price, which is relatively stable, and we can't modifiy it for demostration purposes. To se how the behavior the protocol has when XAH price goes down see EXAMPLE 1 where we change oracle XAH price from 33 XAI USD to 10 XAI USD. When data is available for Example 2 we will update this section.
